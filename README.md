This is resturant website where one can order food and get it at their comfort zone with reasonable price.
I use only two colors which are papayawhip and dark redish brown throughout the entire website for different containers and fonts as well since they compliment one another.
I use media queies with one utility class that hold differnt sections to enhance responsiveness across different devices from SM to XL.
I use the same font size and weight for bigger headings,smaller headings and paragraphs.
